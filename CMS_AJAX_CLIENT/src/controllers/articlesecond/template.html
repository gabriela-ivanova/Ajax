   <h1 class="article-header">8 Occupations Hit Hardest by the Pandemic in 2020</h1><br>
   <div class="img" id="img-2"></div>
   
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the job market in 2020, as
            many businesses laid off workers due to temporary shutdowns and other companies
            shifted their entire to staff to remote work. The biggest job losses came in April, when
            the nation’s unemployment rate reached a staggering 14.7 percent, with 20.5 million
            people suddenly out of work. The jobless rate that month for adults age 55 and older hit
            13.6 percent.<br><br>

            Since that peak, the unemployment rate has slowly declined, but not all occupations
            have recovered equally. Recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows
            which fields had unemployment rates that were significantly higher for December 2020
            than they were one year earlier. The repercussions of millions of Americans staying
            home to help slow the spread of the coronavirus rippled through the job market, causing
            high job losses in fields as diverse as petroleum extraction and dry-cleaning. And some
            of the areas that continue to struggle as 2020 ends — such as restaurant positions and
            independent contract work — are fields that typically are attractive to older workers due
            to their flexible hours.<br><br>

            Here are the eight job fields that have been hardest hit by the pandemic in 2020:<br><br>

        <span class="subpoint">1. Leisure and hospitality jobs;</span><br>
        <span>•	Unemployment rate, December 2020: 16.7 percent;<br>
              •	Unemployment rate, December 2019: 5.0 percent;<br>
              •	Year-over-year increase: 11.7 percentage points;<br><br></span>

            No surprises here. With restaurants, bars, and stadiums temporarily shut down or
            operating on limited capacity for most of the year, many workers at these businesses
            lost jobs. Still, the numbers nationwide are shocking. In December 2020, there were 1.3
            million fewer workers in these fields were than there were one year earlier.<br><br>

        <span class="subpoint">2. Support jobs for mining and oil and gas extraction</span><br>
        <span>•	Unemployment rate, December 2020: 13.1 percent;<br>
              •	Unemployment rate, December 2019: 3.8 percent;<br>
              •	Year-over-year increase: 9.3 percentage points;<br><br></span>

            Sudden and widespread shifts in demand affected these occupations in 2020. For
            example, with businesses temporarily closed for public health reasons, people weren’t
            driving as much and the demand for gas dropped in some regions. Companies in these
            industries responded to the uncertainties by laying off or furloughing workers in support
            positions. There were nearly 58,000 fewer workers in these roles in December 2020
            than there were one year earlier.<br><br>

        <span class="subpoint">3. Travel and transportation jobs</span><br>
        <span>•	Unemployment rate, December 2020: 8.4 percent;<br>
              •	Unemployment rate, December 2019: 2.6 percent;<br>
              •	Year-over-year increase: 5.8 percentage points;<br><br></span>

            The job losses in these fields were fueled by layoffs in the airline and railroad
            businesses, which were hurt because fewer people felt comfortable traveling this year.
            There were nearly 116,500 fewer jobs in air transportation in December 2020 than there
            were one year earlier. Railroads shed at least 18,900 jobs during that same period. The
            pandemic also led to layoffs among truck drivers — a career with a fairly high
            percentage of older workers — because businesses that were temporarily shuttered
            needed fewer supplies.<br><br>

        <span class="subpoint">4. Construction jobs</span><br>
        <span>•	Unemployment rate, December 2020: 9.6 percent;<br>
              •	Unemployment rate, December 2019: 5.0 percent;<br>
              •	Year-over-year increase: 4.6 percentage points;<br><br></span>

            The big losses in these occupations appears to be among the specialty contractors who
            work on nonresidential buildings. That field lost nearly 441,000 jobs between December
            2019 and December 2020, due in part to a slowdown in renovations of office buildings
            as more companies shifted to remote work.<br><br>

        <span class="subpoint">5. Motion picture and music industry jobs</span><br>
        <span>•	Unemployment rate, December 2020: 6.4 percent;<br>
              •	Unemployment rate, December 2019: 1.9 percent;<br>
              •	Year-over-year increase: 4.5 percentage points;<br><br></span>

            It’s hard to make blockbuster movies and TV shows when safety precautions mean you
            can’t have a large cast and crew on the set. Hollywood lost more than 110,000 jobs
            between December 2019 and December 2020.  It’s unclear when and if the film industry
            will recover, as California recently initiated another round of lockdowns to slow the
            spread of the coronavirus and many movie theaters nationwide remain closed.<br><br>

        <span class="subpoint">6. Laundry, dry-cleaning, other personal service jobs</span><br>
        <span>•	Unemployment rate, December 2020: 7.4 percent;<br>
              •	Unemployment rate, December 2019: 3.2 percent;<br>
              •	Year-over-year increase: 4.2 percentage points;<br><br></span>

            The large increase in the number of people working from home this year led to a big
            drop-off in the demand for dry-cleaning and laundry services. Those occupations lost
            more than 228,000 jobs since December 2019.<br><br>

        <span class="subpoint">7. Self-employed workers</span><br>
        <span>•	Unemployment rate, December 2020: 6.7 percent;<br>
              •	Unemployment rate, December 2019: 2.7 percent;<br>
              •	Year-over-year increase: 4.0 percentage points;<br><br></span>

            While working for yourself can offer the freedom and flexibility that many older adults
            prefer, it also means you might face challenges finding clients during tough economic
            times. The pandemic may have added to the difficulties because it made people wary to
            meet face to face, a key part of networking for new business for many.<br><br>

        <span class="subpoint">8. Jobs manufacturing food, clothing and other goods</span><br>
        <span>•	Unemployment rate, December 2020: 5.5 percent;<br>
              •	Unemployment rate, December 2019: 3.1 percent;<br>
              •	Year-over-year increase: 2.4 percentage points;<br><br></span>

            Manufacturing jobs often require people to work side by side, a significant hurdle when
            businesses want their employees to practice physical distancing. There were several
            COVID-19 clusters in meatpacking and poultry processing facilities earlier in the
            pandemic, which may have led some workers to leave the industry.
            Apparel manufacturing businesses notably shed jobs. With more people working from
            home and also not going out at night, the need for new, stylish clothing took a dip.
