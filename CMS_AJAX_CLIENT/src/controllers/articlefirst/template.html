        Salary Range: from 6,020 BGN to 19,200 BGN<br>
        Surgeons top the list of the highest paying careers due to the critical nature of their job.

        learning path; the necessary ingredients for a high paying career.<br><br>


        <span class="subpoint">2. Judges</span><br>
        Salary Range: from 5,060 BGN to 16,100 BGN<br>
        Judges earn quite high salaries because of the huge responsibilities associated with

        justified.<br><br>

        Salary Range: from 4,090 BGN to 13,000 BGN<br>
        The main reason that lawyers earn big wages is because of their high perceived value
        in the eyes of their clients. A successful lawyer can save/earn you tons of money or can
        possibly spare you a death sentence.<br><br>


        <span class="subpoint">4. Bank Managers</span><br>
        Salary Range: from 3,850 BGN to 12,300 BGN<br>

        risks that come along makes managing a bank an extremely critical task worthy of a
        large salary.<br><br>


        <span class="subpoint">5. Chief Executive Officers</span><br>
        Salary Range: from 3,610 BGN to 11,500 BGN<br>

        Salary Range: from 3,370 BGN to 10,700 BGN<br>

        manage budgets, spending, costs, and revenue which directly impacts the operations of
        the organization.<br><br>


        <span class="subpoint">7. Orthodontists</span><br>
        Salary Range: from 3,250 BGN to 10,400 BGN<br>
